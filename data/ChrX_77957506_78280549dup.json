This duplication contains 4 OMIM associated genes including full duplication of TAF9B and PGK1, as well as partial duplication of genes CYSLTR1 and ATP7A. To our current knowledge, the duplication identified  in this individual has not been reported  in the literature. Of the four OMIM associated genes within this duplication, two are disease associated. Pathogenic variants in PGK1 are associated with Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 deficiency (MIM#300653), and pathogenic variants in ATP7A are associated with Menkes disease (MIM#309400), Occipital horn syndrome (MIM#304150), and Spinal muscular atrophy, distal, X-Linked 3 (MIM#300489).  Given the uncertainty regarding the functional consequence of the Xq21.1 duplication, it is reported here as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.","Explanation if clinical significance is other or drug response":null,"Drug response condition":null,"Functional consequence":null,"Comment on functional consequence":null,"click '+' above this column for more columns about clinical significance information":null,"Collection method":null,"Allele origin":null,"Affected status":null,"Structural variant method\/analysis type":null,"Clinical features":null,"Comment on clinical features":null,"Date phenotype was evaluated":null,"Tissue":null,"Sex":null,"Age range":null,"Population Group\/Ethnicity":null,"Geographic origin":null,"Family history":null,"Indication":null,"Total number of individuals tested":null,"Number of families tested":null,"click '+' above this column to add more details of individuals tested":null,"Number of individuals with variant":null,"Number of chromosomes with variant":null,"Number of families with variant":null,"Number of families with segregation observed":null,"Secondary finding":null,"Mosaicism":null,"Number of homozygotes ":null,"Number of single heterozygotes":null,"Number of compound heterozygotes":null,"Number of hemizygotes":null,"Evidence citations":null,"Citations or URLs that cannot be represented in evidence citations column":null,"Comment on evidence":null,"click '+' above this column to add more details of testing results":null,"Test name or type":null,"Platform type":null,"Platform name":null,"Method":null,"Method purpose":null,"Method citations":null,"Software name and version":null,"Software purpose":null,"Testing laboratory":null,"Date variant was reported to submitter":null,"Testing laboratory interpretation":null,"click '+' above this column to add more methods data":null,"Comment":null,"Private comment":null,"ClinVarAccession":null,"Novel or Update":null,"Replaces ClinVarAccessions ":null}]
