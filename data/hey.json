This variant is found in 21 heterozygous individuals in gnomAD(v3.0), with an allele frequency of 1.49e-4. This variant is reported in ClinVar as Pathogenic (VarID:65758), and is the most common pathogenic PRRT2 variant identified in affected individuals [PMID:29334453; PMID:26598493; PMID:24370076]. Functional studies suggest this variant is subject to rapid nonsense mediated decay [PMID:25457817]. Given this, the inherited c.649dup (p.Arg217ProfsTer8) variant identified in the PRRT2 gene is reported as Pathogenic.","Explanation if clinical significance is other or drug response":null,"Drug response condition":null,"Functional consequence":null,"Comment on functional consequence":null,"click '+' above this column for more columns about clinical significance information":null,"Collection method":null,"Allele origin":null,"Affected status":null,"Structural variant method\/analysis type":null,"Clinical features":null,"Comment on clinical features":null,"Date phenotype was evaluated":null,"Tissue":null,"Sex":null,"Age range":null,"Population Group\/Ethnicity":null,"Geographic origin":null,"Family history":null,"Indication":null,"Total number of individuals tested":null,"Number of families tested":null,"click '+' above this column to add more details of individuals tested":null,"Number of individuals with variant":null,"Number of chromosomes with variant":null,"Number of families with variant":null,"Number of families with segregation observed":null,"Secondary finding":null,"Mosaicism":null,"Number of homozygotes ":null,"Number of single heterozygotes":null,"Number of compound heterozygotes":null,"Number of hemizygotes":null,"Evidence citations":null,"Citations or URLs that cannot be represented in evidence citations column":null,"Comment on evidence":null,"click '+' above this column to add more details of testing results":null,"Test name or type":null,"Platform type":null,"Platform name":null,"Method":null,"Method purpose":null,"Method citations":null,"Software name and version":null,"Software purpose":null,"Testing laboratory":null,"Date variant was reported to submitter":null,"Testing laboratory interpretation":null,"click '+' above this column to add more methods data":null,"Comment":null,"Private comment":null,"ClinVarAccession":null,"Novel or Update":null,"Replaces ClinVarAccessions ":null}}
